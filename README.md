## Hey guys! This is my first ever app, it doesn't have any functionality, the main goal of this project was to learn about:
- How to set up a new Xcode project.
- How to use the Interface Builder to design and create the appearance of your app.
- How to find your way around Xcode.
- How to size and arrange various UI elements.
- How to add custom image assets to Xcode projects.
- How to create app icons and size them for all resolutions. How to run apps on the iOS Simulator as well as sideload to a physical device.
